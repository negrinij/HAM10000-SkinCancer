On this coursework we were required to apply three different ANN models to solve any problem we desired. This projec goal is to detect skin cancer using HAM10000 public dataset. My custom CNN outperformed MLP and pre-trained ResNet-50.

This was a coursework for Artificial Neural Networks discipline in Coventry University. Please refer to the presentation and the written coursework for further information.
