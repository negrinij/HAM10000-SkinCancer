For this project I applied three different ANN models to detect skin cancer using HAM10000 public dataset. My custom CNN outperformed MLP and pre-trained ResNet-50.

This was a coursework for Artificial Neural Networks discipline. Please refer to the presentation and the written coursework for further information.
